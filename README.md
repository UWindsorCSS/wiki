# Get Started

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Docusaurus is a **static-site generator**. It builds a **single-page application** with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of **React** to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box **documentation features** but can be used to create **any kind of site** (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).



## Dependencies

* **Nodejs** version >= 14 or above

* **Yarn** version >= 1.5
* **NPM** [Guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)



## How to install

Windows and Mac users download [Nodejs installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from their Official website.																			

```bash
### Install Dependencies for Windows
# Install Node from the link above 
npm install --global yarn

### Install Dependencies for Debian based(Ubuntu)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install npm -y
sudo npm install --global yarn -y
sudo apt-get install git // In case, Not installed

### Install Dependencies for Mac

npm install --global yarn
```



## Local Development

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UWindsorCSS/Wiki.git
```



2. Start the Server

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Open web browser the enter the address `http://localhost:3000/wiki/`

**Alternatively, Use follwoing command to access application from other machine in your network:**

`yarn start --host 0.0.0.0`

Open web browser the enter the address `http://ip-address-of-other-machine:3000/wiki/`

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Formatting

We use [prettier](https://prettier.io). Prettier automatically formats markdown and javascript so it is extremely useful to use.

This **MUST** be run before making a pull request

### Automatically Running

If you use VSCode, I highly recommend the prettier plugin.

If you don't use VSCode, we are assuming that you can figure out your editors plugin for prettier.

### Manually Running

To manually run prettier, please run

```console
yarn prettier --write .
```
