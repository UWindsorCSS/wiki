This is a guide on how to pay full price for your textbooks and not save hundreds of dollars downloading them online.

## We Love the Law

Here at the Computer Science Society, we love the law. We definitely recommend you to pay full price for a new book from the UWindsor bookstore and definitely do not recommend you to use the following sites such to get your textbooks **for free** and save hundreds of dollars without an account. These sites definitely do not provide free, safe files:

-   [b-ok.cc](https://b-ok.cc)
-   [libgen.is](https://libgen.is/)
-   [pdfdrive.com](https://pdfdrive.com/)

:::warning
Downloading textbooks for free online is illegal, and definitely always enforced. We do not recommend you to use the above sites, we have campus security on speed dial.

## Don't Share This

Also, while you're taking care to not download your textbooks for free, you should also make sure you definitely do not share this guide with your friends. This way they too are warned against downloading free textbooks without an account.
