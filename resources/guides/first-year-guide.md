This guide is intended to help incoming first year students prepare for a computer science degree at the University of Windsor. It addresses some general information about being a student at the University of Windsor and provides resources specifically to help students succeed in computer science courses.

## Getting Started at the University of Windsor

### UWin Accounts

Every student must have a **UWin Account** in order to access the university's online services. Instructions to set up your UWin account will be sent to your personal email after you've been accepted into a program at the university. You will be assigned a **UWin ID** and will create a password during this process; these will be used as your login information. Your **UWindsor email** will be yourUWinI@uwindsor.ca.

### Online Services

Some of the online services you can access using your UWin Account include:

#### [UWinsite Student](https://student.uwindsor.ca)

For browsing and enrolling in classes, viewing tuition and fees, accessing acedamic information, applying for scholarships, and more. See the [UWinsite Guide](/wiki/resources/guides/uwinsite-guide) for more details and help.

#### [Brightspace](https://brightspace.uwindsor.ca)

The university's Learning Management System (LMS). It is used to view course material, submit coursework, review grades, and more.

#### [Microsoft Office 365](https://portal.office.com/)

All University of Windsor students have access to a full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools and software, including **Outlook** for email services and **OneDrive** for 1 TB of free cloud storage. A Microsoft Account is automatically created using your **UWindsor Email** and **UWin Account Password**. See [this FAQ](https://uwindsor.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1975/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=9552) for more details.

## Enrolling in Courses

### Which Courses to Take

These wiki resources are maintained by student contributors. Always verify important academic information with a primary university resource or an academic advisor.

:::

There are several computer science programs offered by the University of Windsor, each with their own course requirements which can be found in [the undergraduate calendar](https://www.uwindsor.ca/secretariat/282/undergraduate-and-graduate-calendars). If you follow the [recommended course sequence](/wiki/courses/course-planning/recommended-sequence), many programs will share the same courses for the first term. They are [COMP-1000](/wiki/courses/comp-1000/overview), [COMP-1400](/wiki/courses/comp-1400/overview), MATH-1250 (or MATH-1260), MATH-1720 (or MATH-1760), and an elective. See the [Courses](/wiki/courses) section for a user-friendly table of course requirements by program.

### How to Enroll

Incoming first year students typically have the earliest **appointment time** and may enroll in courses before all other students. Your appointment time can be found on [UWinsite](https://student.uwindsor.ca) under **My Academics -> Enrollment Deadlines**. It is recommended to enroll as early as possible, as courses have a limited capacity and desireable timeslots fill up quickly. See the [UWinsite Guide](/wiki/resources/guides/uwinsite-guide#how-to-plan--enroll-in-classes) for more details on how to enroll in classes.

## Recommended Software for Computer Science
