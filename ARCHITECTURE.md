# Architecture

**This document describes the high-level architecture of this project**

If you want to familiarize yourself with the code base and _generally_ how it works, this is a good place to be.

## High Level TLDR

Docusaurus is the static site generator we use. It works by transforming markdown files(`.md`) and markdown with react(`.mdx`) to html. You put the markdown files in specific folders to denote specific sections. There are some configuration files to specify how Docusaurus acts and some React files for specific landing pages.

## Code Map

_The order is a loose grouping of sections and importance_

### Code Map Legend

`<file name>` for a file name

`<folder name>/` for a folder

`<folder name>/<file name>` for a file within a folder

`<folder name>/<another folder name>/` for a folder within a folder

### `docusaurus.config.js`

This is the master configuration for the wiki. This includes everything from section definitions and linking to specific side bars to defining what goes on the nav bar and footer. If you want to learn how the wiki is specifically layed out, this is the file to read.
